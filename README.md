**Baby Game**

**Objective:**

- Start the game and be taken to the top-down level scrolling map.
- Approach the house with ‘Level One’ above it and enter it by walking up to the house
- Play through the level, collect items, and kill enemies
- Complete and exit the level and return to the top-down level map
- Interact with the NPC below you and collect the key to go into the boss fight
- Enter the boss fight (across from level one) and attempt to defeat the boss.

**How to Run:**

1. Before cloning, install Godot. This game is a godot project and requires Godot 4.3 - .NET version, the link can be found here for [Windows](https://godotengine.org/download/windows/) and [Mac](https://godotengine.org/download/macos/). There will also be a link at the bottom of the page for a tutorial to download and set up Godot. The .NET version is necessary because we programmed the game in C#, not GDScript. You also need to make sure you download the .NET SDK [here] (https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download).
2. Clone the repository
3. In the Team-12 Repository navigate to the new-game-project folder. This contains all of the material we used for and implemented in our game.
4. At the very bottom of the folder there is a file named ‘project.godot’ and opening this file will open the entire project in the Godot game engine
5. Once in the Godot engine, all you have to do is click the small play arrow in the top right corner of the app and the game will run from the start screen. If you want to develop, work, or mess around with other scenes you can open the scene and click the 6th button from the left that looks like a play button in a clapperboard.

**Controls:**

- Player Movement: To move the character use ‘w : up, a : left, s : down, d : right’ in the level choosing menu. In the levels itself use ‘a : left , d : right, space : jump, shift : dash’.
- Attacking: damage can be done to enemies by jumping on them
- Interactions: Tables, shelves,and beds are designed to be jumped on/over and used to help kill enemies. Other objects can be interacted to consume/pickup and the controls to do so appear above the item in game.

**Repo Details:**

- There are two main folders in the primary Team-12 folder : Assets and new-game-project. The assets folder only contains a testing environment, tutorial, and practice, that IS NOT a part of our final game. The new-game-project contains all of the material for our game.

**Troubleshooting:**

- If when playing the game and the dash does not work in all directions (up, down, left, and right), you might need to go into GODOT and at the top settings select Project -> Input Map -> and then remap the controls to your liking.
